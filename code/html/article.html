                                            would not think it so strong as it really is. By experiment its one and fifty 
                                            yarns will each suspend a weight of one hundred and twenty pounds; so 
                                            that the whole rope will bear a strain nearly equal to three tons. In length, 
                                            the common sperm whale-line measures something over two hundred 
                                            fathoms. Towards the stern of the boat it is spirally coiled away in the tub, 
                                            not like the worm-pipe of a still though, but so as to form one round, 
                                            cheese-shaped mass of densely bedded "sheaves," or layers of concentric 
                                            spiralizations, without any hollow but the "heart," or minute vertical tube
                                            formed at the axis of the cheese.

                                        <p class = "article__page">Soon all the boats but Starbuck's were dropped; all the boat-sails set all the 
                                            paddles plying; with rippling swiftness, shooting to leeward; and Ahab 
                                            heading the onset. A pale, death-glimmer lit up Fedallah's sunken eyes; a 
                                            hideous motion. The line originally used in the fishery was of the best hemp 
                                            slightly vapoured with tar, not impregnated with it, as in the case of 
                                            ordinary ropes; for while tar, as ordinarily used, makes the hemp more 
                                            pliable to the rope-maker, and also renders the rope itself more convenient 
                                            to the sailor for common ship use; yet, not only would the ordinary quantity 
                                            too much stiffen the whale-line for the close coiling to which it must be 
                                            subjected; but as most seamen are beginning to learn, tar in general by no 
                                            means adds to the rope's durability or strength, however much it may give 
                                            it compactness and gloss.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class = "article__page">Both ends of the line are exposed; the lower end terminating in an eye-
                                            splice or loop coming up from the bottom against the side of the tub, and 
                                            hanging over its edge completely disengaged from everything. This 
                                            arrangement of the lower end is necessary on two accounts. First: In order 
                                            to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional line from a neighboring boat, 
                                            in case the stricken whale should sound so deep as to threaten to carry off 
                                            the entire line originally attached to the harpoon. In these instances, the 
                                            whale of courseis shifted like a mug of ale, as it were, from the one boat to 
                                            the other; though the first boat always hovers at hand to assist its consort. 
                                            Second: This arrangement is indispensable for common safety's sake.
                                            As the least tangle or kink in the coiling would, in running out, infallibly take 
                                            somebody's arm, leg, or entire body off, the utmost precaution is used in 
                                            stowing the line in its tub. Some harpooneers will consume almost an entire 
                                            morning in this business, carrying the line high aloft and then reeving it 
                                            downwards through a block towards the tub, so as in the act of coiling to 
                                            free it from all possible wrinkles and twists.
